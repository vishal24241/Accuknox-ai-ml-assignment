AccuKnox AI/ML Assignment

Name: Vishal Kumar

Overview

This repository contains my submission for the Trainee AI/ML position at AccuKnox.
The assignment focuses on Python programming, database handling, data processing, and my understanding of AI/ML concepts.
All solutions were implemented by me while learning Python, databases, and basic data analysis concepts, and reflect my current understanding.

Assignment 1 – Python & Database Tasks
1. API Data Retrieval and Storage

Fetches data from a public REST API

Stores the data in a local SQLite database

Displays stored records using Python

Skills used: Python, Requests, SQLite

2. Data Processing and Visualization.

Processes student score data from JSON/API

Calculates average scores

Visualizes results using a bar chart

Skills used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

3. CSV Data Import to Database

Reads user data from a CSV file

Inserts records into a SQLite database

Verifies stored data

Skills used: Python, CSV handling, SQLite

Assignment 2 – Conceptual Understanding

Assignment 2 contains my responses on:

Self-rating in AI, ML, Deep Learning, and LLMs

High-level architecture of an LLM-based chatbot

Understanding of vector databases and selection for a use case

The responses are based on my current learning and research.
Figures, tables, and examples are used where helpful.

Complex Code References

Most Complex Python Code

Link:

https://github.com/vishal24241/accuknox-ai-ml-assignment/blob/main/Assignment-1/student_scores_visualization.py

Description: This script handles reading data from a JSON file, calculating average student scores, and visualizing the results using a bar chart. I focused on writing clear logic so the data flow is easy to understand.

Most Complex Database Code

Link:

https://github.com/vishal24241/accuknox-ai-ml-assignment/blob/main/Assignment-1/api_to_sqlite.py

Description: This script fetches data from a REST API, creates a SQLite database table, inserts records using parameterized queries, and retrieves the stored data for verification.

Final Note

This assignment reflects my honest effort and the way I approach learning new technical concepts through practice.
