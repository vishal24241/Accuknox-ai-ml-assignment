AccuKnox AI/ML Assignment

This repository contains my submission for the Trainee AI/ML position at AccuKnox.
All tasks are implemented using Python with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and correctness.
The goal of this assignment was to demonstrate my understanding of Python programming, basic databases, and data handling.

All Assignment-1 related scripts and data files are kept inside the Assignment-1 folder for better organization.

Assignment 1 – Description
1. API Data Retrieval and Storage

File: api_to_sqlite.py

Fetches data from a public REST API

Extracts required fields from JSON

Stores the data into a local SQLite database

Reads and prints the stored data to verify insertion

This script helped me understand how API data can be stored locally for further processing.

2. Student Scores Processing and Visualization

File: student_scores_visualization.py

Reads student score data from a JSON file

Calculates the average score

Visualizes the scores using a bar chart

This task demonstrates basic data processing and visualization using Python.

3. CSV Data Import to SQLite

File: csv_to_sqlite.py

Reads user data from a CSV file

Creates a SQLite table

Inserts CSV records into the database

Prints stored data for verification

This script shows how CSV data can be integrated with a database.

▶️ How to Run the Code

Make sure Python is installed

Install required libraries (if not already installed):

pip install requests matplotlib


Navigate to the Assignment-1 folder:

cd Assignment-1


Run any script:

python api_to_sqlite.py

🧠 Learning Outcome

Through this assignment, I improved my understanding of:

Python scripting

REST APIs

SQLite databases

JSON and CSV data handling

Basic data visualization

All code was written and tested by me as part of my learning process.
